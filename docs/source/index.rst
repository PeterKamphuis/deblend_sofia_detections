Welcome to 'deblend-sofia-detections' documentation!
=================================
**deblend-sofia-detections** is a python package implementation and enhanced version of 
the watershed methods published in https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...980..157H/abstract

This started as an adapted copy of the accompanying ipython notebook of that paper and evolved from there
and as such Qifeng Huang deserves credit for the original implementation.
